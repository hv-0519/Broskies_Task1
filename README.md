# Library Database System

##  Project Overview
This project implements a relational database schema for a **Library Management System**. The database is designed using MySQL and follows normalization rules up to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and improve query efficiency.

---

##  Features
- Organized storage of **Books**, **Authors**, **Publishers**, **Members**, and **Book Loans**.
- Many-to-many relationship between **Books** and **Authors** using a join table.
- Referential integrity through foreign keys.
- Normalized design to avoid data duplication and ensure consistency.
